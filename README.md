# Onboarding the Community into ProximaX Sirius MAINNET

This readme contains the official ProximaX instructions on how to use the community distribution for a Sirius Blockchain Peer.  The deployable Peer automatically hooks-up to ProximaX MAINNET, provided you have setup the harvesterKey.

There are two main ways to use the distribution:
1. - [Vagrant Box](https://github.com/proximax-storage/community-onboarding/tree/master/vagrant-method)
